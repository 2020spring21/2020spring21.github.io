  <h1>Web Accessibility</h1>
  <div>  </div>
  <h2> Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can, navigate, and interact with the Web and to contribute to the Web. Web accessibility is looking to help all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual. </h2>

      <p> Making the web accessible to everyone is necessary, because when more people have access to the web, the easier and quicker information can be transmitted or sent. Some examples of how accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for everyone in a variety of situations. </p>
      <p>Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example: people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc. Web accessibility also helps older people with changing abilities due to ageing. Web accessibility helps people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm, where mobility is limited and you need help navigating a website. People with “situational limitations'' such as in an environment where they cannot listen to audio are greatly helped by Web accessibility in websites. People using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth, can also be aided by Web accessibility in ways such as making a website not very difficult to load. </p>
      <p> Auditory Disabilities make viewing a website dificult sometimes, as some web developers do not take Auditory Disabilities into account when making their website. When a video plays on a website, you can hear and understand what they are saying, but a person who is deaf can not. A simple solution to helping people with Auditory Disabilities is to just put subtitles on your videos. </p>
