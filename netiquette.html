  <h1>Netiquette For Social Media</h1>
  <div> <span>
    <h3 id="float">Before you say something to someone online, always ask yourself:
      Is this respectful, and would I say this to the person's face?</h3>
    </span> </div>
  <h2> Social media is a place on the internet where ideas can be shared, where users can communicate with one another, and where knowledge can be transferred and shared. But social media can also hold users who are disrespectful to others, and can spread lies and misinformation about other people. People who are like this do not have proper Netiquette. In the following paragraphs, I will go over proper netiquette, and the few rules you need to know. </h2>

      <p> Rule 1: respect the person behind the screen
        Behind every screen, there is a real person. When you are speaking to a user online, you need to be respectful to them, and you must remember that you are talking to a real person. Treat others online how you would want to be treated in real life. Whenever you are going to say something online, you have to think: would I say this to the person's face? It is easier to say disrespectful things online then in person, so treat the other people with respect. </p>
      <p>Rule 2: respect other people's privacy 
        When you are going to post something online, whether it's a photo of you and your friend or a post about an experience you had with someone you know, you have to respect their privacy and remember that they might not want information about themselves shared online. If you are going to post a photo of you and someone else, you must respect their privacy. This can be done by asking if it's ok to post the photo, or just not posting it at all. </p>
      <p>Rule 3: be patient with others
        You might be great with computers, and you might be able to navigate the web with ease, but lots of people are new to computers and don't know how to work things as well as you. This means that you have to be patient with others online. Do not be rude when you encounter someone's mistake -- always respond with courtesy and respect. </p>
